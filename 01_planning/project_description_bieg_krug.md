# Project description - Analyseanwendungen ILV S2020

## Project content

We plan to analyse a subset of the `World Development Indicators` dataset available here: <https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators>

The dataset contains more than 1,000 development indicators for countries around the world. We will select a subset of meaningful indicators. Specifically, we will choose meaningful "general" indicators (e.g. gross domestic product, life expectancy, fertility rate) as well as indicators related to energy consumption (e.g. use of fossil fuels and renewable energy).

We will explore relationships between those indicators, differences between countries, and trends over time.
